An interactive narative driven audio-visual experience for the web, generated using Three.JS to procedurally generate in WebGL the dynamic environment. The project is an exploration into the effects of a dynamic ambience meant to demonstrate the effects of ocean degradation and elicit and emotional response from users while they explore and collect artefacts that reveal information about the causes of the degrading oceans. The aim of the project is to discover if by eliciting an emotional response, users are more willing to change their lifestyle or opinion of ocean degradation. Effectiveness of the project is measured by user research findings, which proved it to be effective at elliciting an emotional response.",
